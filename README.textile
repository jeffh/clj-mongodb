h1. clj-mongodb

Clj-mongodb is a wrapper around the "Java MongoDB Driver":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Tutorial.

MongoDB is partitioned into several objects to operate on:

* Connection: The base connection object which is lazy (connecting only when
               it needs to).
* Database: Database holds a series of collections. Identical to SQL-based
             databases.
* Collection: Collections hold a series of documents. Similar to a SQL table.
* Document: Holds a collection of key-value pairs like a map. Similar to a SQL
             table row, but with no defined fields.

Each object belongs to a specific instance to the one above it like so:

Connection => Database => Collection => Document

The majority of the functions operate on one of the types above and require
previous object in order to operate on it. Attempting to get a database or
collection creates it if the database or collection doesn't already exist.

# Use (mongo-connect str-host int-port) to create a connection. (mongo-connect)
also accepts two additional arguments for username and password if required.
# Use (get-db connection str-name) to return a database.
# Use (get-coll db str-name) to return a collection.
# Use (get-docs collection type & kwargs) to get documents where:
** type is either :first or :all which fetches one or a sequence of documents.
        Documents are represented as clojure maps.
** kwargs is a hash-map (without the {}) that accepts specific keys
*** *:where* accepts a map of field to value comparisons. So if you wanted to do
    WHERE x=1 pass the map {:x 1}.
*** *:fields* accepts a map of fields to include or exclude. For example:
    {:a 1, :b 0} includes field a in results, but not field b.
*** *:limit* accepts the maximum number of documents to fetch.
*** *:sort* is a map of fields to sort by ascending or descending order. For
    example: {:a 1, :b -1} ascending sorts field a and descending sorts field b.
*** *:batch* accepts the number of documents to fetch at a time. Idea use
    in large queries for batch jobs.
*** *:skip* accepts number of documents to skip before returning documents.
*** *:hint* accepts a map marking fields for indexes to utilize
    (eg - {:a true}).
*** *:process-one* accepts a function that processes a DBObject instance.
    Defaults to (doc-map) which converts DBObject instances to clojure maps.
*** *:process-cursor* accepts a function that processes a DBCursor instance.
    Defaults to (doc-maps) which returns a sequence of clojure maps.

h2. with

There are a couple macros that reduce the repetition of passing in a collection,
database, or connection into its functions.

(with-mongo [host port] str-db-name ... body)

Uses (mongo-connect) and (get-db) which works on the functions listed above.

Likewise there is one for collections:

(with-collection str-coll-name ... body)

Which uses (get-coll) to get the collection and all collection functions operate
on the collection.

See the tests of examples of these macros.
